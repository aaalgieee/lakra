## Annotation Fundamentals

### Understanding Quality Criteria

#### Fluency (1-5 scale)
Measures how natural and grammatically correct the translation sounds.

**5 - Excellent**: Perfect grammar, natural flow, sounds like native text
**4 - Good**: Minor grammatical issues, mostly natural
**3 - Fair**: Some grammatical errors, somewhat awkward
**2 - Poor**: Multiple grammar errors, difficult to read
**1 - Very Poor**: Serious grammatical problems, nearly unreadable

#### Adequacy (1-5 scale)
Measures how well the translation conveys the original meaning.

**5 - Excellent**: Perfect meaning preservation, no information loss
**4 - Good**: Minor meaning differences, essentially accurate
**3 - Fair**: Some meaning differences, mostly accurate
**2 - Poor**: Significant meaning changes, partially accurate
**1 - Very Poor**: Major meaning distortions, largely inaccurate

#### Overall Quality (1-5 scale)
Combines fluency and adequacy into a holistic assessment.

**5 - Excellent**: Professional quality, ready for publication
**4 - Good**: High quality, minor editing needed
**3 - Fair**: Acceptable quality, moderate editing needed
**2 - Poor**: Significant issues, major editing required
**1 - Very Poor**: Unacceptable quality, retranslation needed

### Error Classification System

#### Error Types

**MI_ST - Minor Syntax/Terminology**
- Small grammatical errors
- Minor word choice issues
- Punctuation problems
- Article usage errors

**MI_SE - Minor Semantic**
- Slight meaning differences
- Nuance variations
- Minor omissions
- Stylistic variations

**MA_ST - Major Syntax/Terminology**
- Serious grammatical errors
- Major word choice problems
- Sentence structure issues
- Significant terminology errors

**MA_SE - Major Semantic**
- Significant meaning changes
- Major omissions or additions
- Contradictory information
- Complete mistranslations

#### Error Classification Guidelines

1. **Identify the Error**: Determine what is wrong
2. **Assess the Type**: Syntax/grammar vs. meaning
3. **Evaluate Severity**: Minor vs. major impact
4. **Consider Context**: Domain, audience, purpose
5. **Classify Consistently**: Apply standards uniformly

### Annotation Process

   - Add specific comments explaining issues

4. **Provide Quality Scores**
   - Rate fluency based on naturalness
   - Rate adequacy based on meaning preservation
   - Rate overall quality holistically

5. **Create Final Form**
   - Provide corrected translation
   - Ensure accuracy and naturalness
   - Maintain appropriate style and tone

6. **Add Voice Recording** (if applicable)
